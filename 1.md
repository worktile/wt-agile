- 从产品规划到发布
- 冲刺（Sprint）



Scrum is best suited in the case where a cross functional team is working in a product development setting where there is a non trivial amount of work that lends itself to being split into more than one 2 – 4 week iteration.

The Sprint is a timebox of one month or less during which the team produces a potentially shippable product Increment. Typical characteristics of Sprints:

Maintain a consistent duration throughout a development effort
A new Sprint immediately follows the conclusion of the previous Sprint
Start date and end date of Sprint are fixed



Lifecycle
Scrum is a framework that allows development teams flexibility to respond to changing situations. This framework has sufficient control points in place to ensure the team does not stray from the desired outcome, and that issues can be identified and resolved and process adjustments made while the effort is still underway.


The Scrum Lifecycle starts with a prioritized backlog, but does not provide any guidance as to how that backlog is developed or prioritized.


The Scrum Lifecycle consists of a series of Sprints, where the end result is a potentially shippable product increment. Inside of these sprints, all of the activities necessary for the development of the product occur on a small subset of the overall product.  Below is a description of the key steps in the Scrum Lifecycle:

Establish the Product Backlog.
The product owner and development team conduct Sprint Planning. Determine the scope of the Sprint in the first part of Sprint Planning and the plan for delivering that scope in the second half of Sprint Planning.
As the Sprint progresses, development team perform the work necessary to deliver the selected product backlog items.
On a daily basis, the development team coordinate their work in a Daily Scrum.
At the end of the Sprint the development team delivers the Product Backlog Items selected during Sprint Planning. The development team holds a Sprint Review to show the customer the increment and get feedback.  The development team and product owner also reflect on how the Sprint has proceeded so far and adapting their processes accordingly during a retrospective.
The Team repeats steps 2–5 until the desired outcome of the product have been met.
